## About me

I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astronomy.osu.edu) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu). I study star formation and the interstellar medium in nearby galaxies using [JWST](https://webb.nasa.gov), [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), and other observatories. I work in the "Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS" [PHANGS](https://sites.google.com/view/phangs/home?authuser=0) team. 

From 2021-2023 I was a postdoc at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca) working on the JWST Early Release Science program [PDRs4All](https://pdrs4all.org): "Radiative Feedback from Massive Stars as Traced by Multiband Imaging and Spectroscopic Mosaics".

In August 2021 I received my PhD in Astronomy at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca) (advisors: [Christine Wilson](https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~wilson/) and [Laura Parker](https://www.lcpastro.com)). I received my BSc in Physics and MSc in Physics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca).
